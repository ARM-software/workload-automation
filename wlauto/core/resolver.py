        they can discover.

        getters that are registered with the highest priority will be invoked first. If
        multiple getters are registered under the same priority, they will be invoked
        in the order they were registered (i.e. in the order they were discovered). This is
        essentially non-deterministic.

        Generally getters that are more likely to find a resource, or would find a
        "better" version of the resource should register with higher (positive) priorities.
        Fall-back getters that should only be invoked if a resource is not found by usual
        means should register with lower (negative) priorities.
