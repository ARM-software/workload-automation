    A workload to perform standard productivity tasks within Skype. The
    workload logs in to the Skype application, selects a recipient from the
    contacts list and then initiates either a voice or video call.

    Test description:

    1. Open Skype application
    2. Log in to a pre-defined account
    3. Select a recipient from the Contacts list
    4. Initiate either a ``voice`` or ``video`` call for ``duration`` time (in seconds)
       Note: The actual duration of the call may not match exactly the intended duration
       due to the uiautomation overhead.

    **Skype Setup**

       - You must have a Skype account set up and its credentials passed
         as parameters into this workload
       - The contact to be called must be added (and has accepted) to the
         account. It's possible to have multiple contacts in the list, however
         the contact to be called *must* be visible on initial navigation to the
         list.
       - For video calls the contact must be able to received the call. This
         means that there must be a Skype client running (somewhere) with the
         contact logged in and that client must have been configured to
         auto-accept calls from the account on the device (how to set this
         varies between different versions of Skype and between platforms --
         please search online for specific instructions).
